CSC418 - ASSIGNMENT #3 REPORT 

Group : Shuai Ma, Fan-Yi Kung

------------------------------------------Part 1----------------------------------------------
Ray Casting:

	This was implemented through scene traversal to search for existing ray intersections. 
	and call the method shadeRay once the world frame is obtained. 

Intersections: 

	1) ray-sphere intersection
	
	This function was implemented by applying the quadratic formula to search for existing 
	points of intersections of the ray onto the sphere. There are multiple conditions that
	need to be handled, that is, the ray crossing with the sphere, once, twice, or neither
	(none). 

	In the beginning, a ray intersection object was declared for cases when crosses
	existed. The object was later then updateded one by one including the intersection
	point, intersection normal (relative to the vector given from the center)

	2) ray-square intersection

	This function was implemented by obtaining the value of the ray intersection of the
	unit square. We check whether or not the point lies in the domain/range of the square
	by projecting its x,y position of light to the xy plane. 


Phong Shading: 
	
	This function was implemented through theuse of the phone shading formula to calculate
	the differnt light intensities (ambient, diffuse, specular light). 


The part was split into 2 for each member. Since intersections belonged together, we decided to
split the functions as the intersection group and light group in which one of us took over a
part among the two and collaberated together at the end to generate the desired outputs. 



-------------------------------Part 2 Game : "Dodge" -----------------------------------------


Dodge the ball game: 

	
	Instructions: 
		1) Press Space to begin the game and again to quit the game window. 
		2) Move with the numberpad with a keyboard (8, 2, 4, 6) to move up, down, left,
		    and right.
		3) Dodge all the balls and reach the end!

		Note: To load Dodge, type "make" in the "game" directory to compile, then "dodge"
		to run the actual game. 

We decided to adopt the structure of assignment 2 for this part. The objective is to move to
the top of the ramp without getting hit by a ball. We have 10 balls randomly spawning in the
top section of the ramp. We detect collisions with the player every time we animate the next
frame. Controls are the numpad numbers, excluding 5 (8, 2, 4, 6 for up, down, left, and right
and 1, 3, 7, 9 for the diagonals).

-----------------------------------Overall-----------------------------------------------------

Meetups for the assignment and task discussion were very productive and successfull, although
both members have been bearing with heavy schedules and deadlines, we were able to manage.
Meetings were extremely efficient and have given us a solid understanding of what we were
supposed to/assigned to do. Overall the collaberation was decently well. We picked on parts
based off our strengths and would help each other out if either had questions to ask about
their part or regarding the assignment.
